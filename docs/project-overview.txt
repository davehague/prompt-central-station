Project: Prompt Management System

Objective:
Develop a flexible, language-agnostic system for managing, versioning, and executing AI prompts, decoupling prompt management from application code and enabling non-technical users to modify prompts and parameters without code changes.

Pain Points:
1. Tight coupling of prompts, model parameters, and code, requiring code changes for prompt or model updates
2. Inefficient process for adapting to new, potentially cheaper or better LLM models
3. Developers, rather than business stakeholders, often making decisions about prompt content and model selection
4. Lack of version control for prompts independent of code versioning
5. Difficulty in managing and organizing prompts across different projects and business areas
6. Inconsistent interfaces when working with multiple LLM providers
7. Limited observability into prompt performance and usage patterns

Key Features:
1. Hierarchical prompt organization using slugs (e.g., "projectname/business-area/slug-name")
2. YAML-based prompt storage using Microsoft's "prompty" format (https://github.com/microsoft/prompty, https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-prompty/index.html)
3. Git-based versioning for prompts, separate from application code
4. Integration with LLM gateways (primarily OpenRouter) for standardized model interactions
5. Supports both Python and TypeScript
6. Local logging of LLM calls with OpenTelemetry integration for metrics visualization
7. Simple API for developers to execute prompts by ID (slug)

Architecture Components:
1. Prompt Management Layer: Core library for prompt retrieval and execution
2. YAML-based Prompt/Config Storage: For storing prompts and model configurations
3. LLM Gateway: Intermediary for standardized LLM service interactions
4. Local Logging System: For tracking LLM calls and performance metrics
5. OpenTelemetry Integration: For shipping logs to visualization systems

Future Enhancements:
1. Admin UI for non-technical users to edit and test prompts
2. Evaluation datasets for prompt testing
3. Advanced features like A/B testing and prompt chaining

Implementation Approach:
1. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on core functionality
2. Iterate to add enhanced features and integrations
3. Package the library for pip and npm for easy distribution
4. Consider open-sourcing or exploring business opportunities based on adoption and feedback

This project aims to solve the common challenge of prompt management in AI applications, providing a robust, scalable solution that separates concerns between development and business logic, while offering flexibility for future growth and adaptation to new LLM technologies.
