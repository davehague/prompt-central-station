# Implementation Plan for Prompt Management System

## Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. Set up the project structure for both Python and TypeScript libraries
2. Implement YAML parsing for prompt configurations
3. Create a basic PromptManager class with methods to:
   - Load prompts from YAML files
   - Retrieve prompts by slug
   - Execute prompts via OpenRouter
4. Implement basic logging functionality

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Develop a more robust slug-based retrieval system
2. Implement version control integration for YAML files
3. Enhance logging with additional metrics
4. Create a basic CLI for prompt management and testing

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing
1. Integrate OpenTelemetry for advanced logging and metrics
2. Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. Create example projects demonstrating usage in both Python and TypeScript

## Phase 4: Documentation and Packaging
1. Write detailed documentation, including usage guidelines and best practices
2. Prepare the library for distribution via pip and npm
3. Create a project website with quickstart guides and API reference

## Future Phases
1. Develop the Admin UI for prompt management and testing
2. Implement advanced features like A/B testing and prompt chaining
3. Create plugins for popular IDEs to enhance developer experience
